# Using Machine Learning to Identify High Value Customers

In this project I use machine learning to identify high value customers for an online retailer. As part of a marketing strategy, this online retailer is selecting some customers to offer them VIP treatment. Short-term benefits from the VIP program were anticipated to include higher response (holiday repeat purchase) rates and higher spending from the customers selected to receive VIP treatment. Longer-term benefits included increased loyalty and profits from these high-value customers.

 The cost of the program consisted of one-time fixed costs (IT enhancements, infrastructure improvements, and training) and variable costs (differentiated service and marketing).

 Our objective is to construct a scheme for identifying customers for VIP treatment. Obviously, not all customers should receive the enhanced service. Exactly how should we determine who "deserved" VIP treatment and who did not?

 To construct the customer scheme for the upcoming holiday season (Holiday 2001) we try out different customer schemes using known Holiday 2000 purchase results. We pull a random sample of 60,000 customers from the existing customer pool as of September 1999. For all customers on the list we have data on their one year purchase history in addition to their purchase behavior for Holiday 2000 (October-December 2000). Our objective is to design a scheme that accurately determines whether a customer made a purchase on the holiday season for year 2000 and then use the data to determine the accuracy of our models. We can then use the most accurate model to identify customers for VIP treatment.
